<h1>Curriculum: page 3, more pictures, please!</h1>

<p>We've seen how we can use JavaScript to move content around on the
page by changing the CSS. We can even react to the user by listening
to events.</p>

<p>But what if you want to add more photos to you slide show? You
could do it by adding more <code>&lt;img></code> tags to the HTML,
which is not a bad idea.</p>

<p>But we could be very clever, and use JavaScript to add images.
We can add and delete and edit the content of the document, just like
we can change the CSS.</p>

</p>Using JavaScript just to be clever is not a good idea for "real"
web pages. But being clever <em>is</em> a fun way to learn. Plus,
there are situations where editing the content using JavaScript is a
good idea.</p>
