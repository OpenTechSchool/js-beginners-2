<h1>Curriculum: page 3, moving pictures</h1>

<p>You’ve written your HTML and CSS. We got a taste of how to use
JavaScript to move around the content. Now, we’ll learn how to
include your program when the HTML is loaded, so we can make the
content dynamic and interactive. </p>


<h2 class="step">Including a JavaScript file</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see how to set up a JavaScript environment.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>In your editor, create a new file and save it with the name
“slideshow.js” in your <span class="filename">slideshow</span> directory.</p>

<p>In your <span class="filename">slideshow.js</span>, add the line that creates a
reference to film roll:</p>

<pre>
var filmroll = document.getElementById('the-film-roll');
</pre>

<p>In your <code>index.html</code>, include this new file at the very
<strong>end</strong>:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src="slideshow.js">&lt;/script>
</pre>

<p>Back in the browser, refresh the page. Type the following in the
console:</p>

<pre>
filmroll.style.left = '-100px';
</pre>


<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Whoa! Just like images and style sheets, you can load JavaScript
code when you load a web page. Instead of typing by hand on the
console, we can prepare a program, and send it along with the HTML,
CSS or images. Nice!</p>


<h2 class="step">Create a function to move the film roll</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To use <code>setInterval</code> to create a simple animation.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Yesterday we saw that <code>setInterval</code> could be used to run
a function every n milliseconds. We can also stop the function using
<code>clearInterval</code>. Update your <span class="filename">slideshow.js</span>
file to contain this code, and then refresh the browser:</p>

<pre>
var filmroll = document.getElementById('the-film-roll');
var start = 0;
var end = 200;
var current = start;

function move() {
  filmroll.style.left = current + 'px';
  current = current + 1;
  if (current > end) {
    clearInterval(loop); // This stops the loop
  }
}

var loop = setInterval(move, 40);
</pre>

<p>Why can’t we use a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop
for this effect?</p>

<p>Try to speed up the scrolling effect. There are two ways. Which one
works better?</p>

<p>Update the <code>move</code> function to move the film roll 20
pixels every 50 milliseconds.<p>

<p>What if you want to move exactly 110 pixels? Update your function
so that it goes to exactly the end and not more.<p>

<p>Tip: <code>Math.min</code> is a function that takes any number of
arguments, and returns the one that is smallest. Try this:<p>

<pre>
current = Math.min(current + 20, end);
</pre>

<p>Make the photos scroll to the left instead of right.</p>

<p>How much do you have to move the film roll to make it scroll from
the first photo to the second photo?</p>

<p>What happens if your photo width is not a multiple of 20? How can
you fix the problem?<p>

<p>Update the <code>move</code> function so that the direction of
scrolling is only controlled by changing the start and end values.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>To control how fast or slow a loop is performed, we can change the
time between loops, or we can change how big an effect each loop
has.</p>

<p>We used to use <code>setInterval</code> instead of a
<code>while</code> (or <code>for</code>) loop so we could add time
between the loops instead of doing many thousands and thousands of
loops.</p>

<p>In the end, your function might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
function move() {
  filmroll.style.left = current + 'px';

  if (current == end) {
    clearInterval(loop);
  }

  if (end > start) {
    current = Math.min(current + 20, end);
  } else {
    current = Math.max(current - 20, end);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>By using the <code>Math.min</code> and <code>Max.max</code>
functions, we can guarantee that the <code>current</code> value never
goes beyond the <code>end</code> (either bigger or smaller, depending
on direction)</p>


<h2 class="step">Create a scroll function</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Create a re-usable scroll function that can be called multiple
times.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Create a function called <code>scroll</code> that accepts a start position,
and an end position.</p>

<pre>
function scroll(start, end) {
  // now what?
}
</pre>

<p>Move the <code>current</code> counter, your <code>move</code>
function and <code>setInterval</code> inside of <code>scroll</code>.
You no longer need to define start and end variables. Your
<span class="filename">slideshow.js</span> file will look like this:</p>

<pre>
var filmroll = document.getElementById('the-film-roll');

function scroll(start, end) {
  var current = start;

  function move() {
    filmroll.style.left = current + 'px';

    if (current == end) {
      clearInterval(loop);
    }

    if (end > start) {
      current = Math.min(current + 20, end);
    } else {
      current = Math.max(current - 20, end);
    }
  }

  var loop = setInterval(move, 50);
}
</pre>

<p>Refresh the browser.</p>

<p>Use the <code>scroll</code> function to slide to the second photo by typing in
the console type:</p>

<pre>
scroll(0, -500);
</pre>

<p>(… but replace <code>500</code> with the width of one of your photos.)</p>

<p>Use the <code>scroll</code> function to slide from the second photo to the
third.</p>

<p>Scroll back to the second photo.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Now we have a single function we can use to scroll left and right
from any starting position to any ending position. Yay!</p>


<h2 class="step">Add a keydown event listener</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see that we can give control of the slide show to the user.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>In <span class="filename">slideshow.js</span>, add an <em>EventListener</em>
called <code>handleEvent</code> to the <code>document</code> that triggers on
a <code>keydown</code> event, like this:</p>

<pre>
function handleEvent(e) {
  console.log(e, e.keyCode);
}

document.addEventListener('keydown', handleEvent);
</pre>

<p>In Chrome, be sure you have the Console tab open in the Developer
Tools.</p>

<p>Refresh the page.</p>

<p>Begin pressing any of the keys, and while you do, watch the
output that is logged in the console.</p>

<p>What are the <code>keyCode</code>s for the left and right arrow
keys?</p>

<p>Update the <code>handleEvent</code> function to call a function
that scrolls left or right when the left or right arrow is
pressed:</p>

<pre>
function handleEvent(e) {
  backAndForth(e.keyCode);
}

function backAndForth(keyCode) {
  if (keyCode == 37) {
    scroll(500, 0);
  }

  if (keyCode == 39) {
    scroll(0, 500);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>(… but replace <code>500</code> with the width of one of your photos.)</p>

<p>Try out this new functionality in Chrome. Remember to always
refresh the page when you change your JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Why doesn’t it keep scrolling in the same direction when you press
the same arrow?</p>

<p>Store the current scrolling position in a variable, and after
calling the <code>scroll</code> function, update the value of the
current position. Always use the current position as the <code>start</code>
value when you call the <code>scroll</code> function.</p>

<p>Try it first! But if you need help, take a peek below:</p>

<pre>
var current = 0;

function backAndForth(keyCode) {
  if (keyCode == 37) {
    scroll(current, current - 500);
    current = current - 500;
  }

  if (keyCode == 39) {
    scroll(current, current + 500);
    current = current + 500;
  }
}
</pre>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>When JavaScript runs in your browser (which is all the time, unless
you shut off JavaScript), it is always “listening” to <em>events</em>, like
whether you type something, or move your mouse. These events have
names like “keydown”, “keyup”, and “click”, and are emitted by all
kinds of elements in the <code>document</code>, and by the
<code>document</code> itself. In this example, we are only listening
to <code>keydown</code> events emitted by the <code>document</code>.</p>

<p>By listening to the events emitted, we can know when the person
viewing the page has <em>interacted</em> with the page. We can look at
what the person did (what they typed, or what they clicked on) and
then we can do something. In this example, we moved the film roll to
the left when the person pressed “left” and we moved it right when the
person pressed “right”.</p>

<p>By listening to <em>input</em> from the person looking at the page,
we can allow the person to control the page.</p>

<p>Pretty cool! And very powerful.</p>


<h2 class="step">Correct buggy behaviour</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see how to prevent events from having an effect when it is not
desirable.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Our functions for listening to events and scrolling have a bug in
them. Maybe you already noticed it. To recreate the bug, try pressing
the left and right arrows faster than the film roll can slide. (So,
start the film roll sliding, and then press either left or right again
before it is finished sliding). You’ll see an ugly flickering effect.</p>

<p>Do you know what is causing it? What can we do to stop it?</p>

<p>Try to fix this bug.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Lots of times when we write code, we forget that our users might do
things that don’t “make sense” at first, or will try to do things we
didn’t think of. Oops. We think our job is done, but then we find out
our code has a bug and we have to correct it (or tell the users “Don’t
do that!” which is sort of rude).</p>

<p>First we have to figure out that the bug exists. Then we have to
figure out why the bug is happening. Then we have to figure out how to
fix it. Lots of programmers think fixing bugs is fun :), since they
are new puzzles to solve.</p>

<p>Did you find a solution? This is one way to fix the bug:</p>

<pre>
<strong>var scrolling = false;</strong>

function scroll(start, end) {
  var current = start;

  var move = function () {
    filmroll.style.left = current + 'px';
<strong>
    if (current == end) {
      clearInterval(loop);
      scrolling = false;
    }
</strong>
    if (end > start) {
      current = Math.min(current + 20, end);
    } else {
      current = Math.max(current - 20, end);
    }
  }

  var loop = setInterval(move, 50);
  <strong>scrolling = true;</strong>
}

function handleEvent(e) {
  <strong>if (!scrolling) {
    backAndForth(e.keyCode);
  }</strong>
}
</pre>

<p>We created a variable that remembers whether or not we are already
scrolling, and if we are, we ignore the keydown event from the
user.</p>

<p>You will notice that this solution uses an exclamation mark in the
<code>if (!scrolling)</code> conditional statement (inside the
<code>handleEvent</code> function). The exclamation mark is called the logical
NOT operator in JavaScript, so the <code>if (!scrolling)</code>
conditional statement has the meaning "if the <code>scrolling</code> variable
is not true".</p>

<p>Maybe this solution to the problem does not fit with what the user expects.
What is reasonable for the user to expect? How can we change the code to do
what the user expects?</p>

<p>Now that we’ve changed CSS, let’s change the HTML too!</p>
