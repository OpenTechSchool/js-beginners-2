<h1>Curriculum: page 2, picture slide show</h1>

<p>We'll learn how JavaScript can make content dynamic and
interactive.</p>

<p>For this project, we will create a photo slide show. You'll have
more fun if your slide show is made from your own photos, or at least
photos you like. So step one is:</p>

<h2 class="step">Download images from Flickr</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Get some nice photos to use in your slide show.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Create a directory for your entire project and call it
“slideshow”</p>

<p>Download three photos and save them in your <code>slideshow</code>
directory.
<br>The photos must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have file type of .jpg, .gif or .png</li>
  <li>Have a width of around 500 pixels.</li>
  <li>All have the same dimensions in pixels.</li>
  <li>All have the same orientation (all landscape, portrait, or
    square)</li>
  <li>Be photos you like. You will look at them all day!</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: you can download any three photos, and edit them to be all
the same size and shape. If you need help finding photos or editing
them, ask a coach for help.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>We will start our slide show with just three photos. To make things
simlier, we want them to be not too big, and not odd sizes.</p>

<h2 class="step">Write HTML to display the photos</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Understand how to display static content by writing HTML.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>In a editor, open a new file.</p>

<p>Save the file with the name “index.html” in your
<code>slideshow</code> directory</p>

<p>Add your photos to the HTML but adding three lines like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;img src="FILE_NAME_OF_THE_FIRST_PHOTO">
&lt;img src="FILE_NAME_OF_THE_SECOND_PHOTO">
&lt;img src="FILE_NAME_OF_THE_THIRD_PHOTO">
</pre>

<p>You must use the complete file name which includes the file
extension, which will be .jpg, .gif or .png.</p>

<p>In Chrome, go to <code>File > Open File…</code>, find your
slideshow/index.html file and open it.</p>

<p>In your text editor, at the very top of the index.html file,
before the <code>&lt;img></code> tags, add:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;head>
  &lt;title>I ♥ Coding&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
</pre>

<p>In Chrome, refresh the page, and take a look at the title of
the tab.</p>

<p>In your text editor, add another line to the head that sets the
character set to UTF-8:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;head>
  &lt;title>I ♥ Coding&lt;/title>
  <strong>&lt;meta charset='utf-8'></strong>
&lt;/head>
</pre>

<p>In Chrome, refresh the page, and take another look at the title of
the tab.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>You've written some HTML and are looking at it in your browser!</p>

<p>You've also added a title, and defined the character set so that
UTF-8 characters are correctly displayed. (UTF-8 is important not just
for hearts, but also for umlauts.)</p>

<p>The first line, the <code>doctype</code> declaration is  important
for a similar reason as setting the character set. This simple line
tells the browser what exact flavor of HTML we have written, so the
browser will treat it in a predictable way. Most HTML looks and
behaves the same everywhere, but once we start applying CSS rules and
using JavaScript, the doctype really matters. If we don't say what
flavor, then the browser has to guess, and it may guess
incorrectly.</p>

<p>Even though our doctype looks very simple, is it very different
from what the the recommended doctype looked like only a couple of
years ago:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
</pre>

<p>Rejoice! You [should] never have to write that ugly thing!<p/>

<aside>Nerdy detail: In Chrome, look at the address of the page. This
address might seem unusual to you if you have never written HTML
before. This web page is located on your computer. If you put this
file on a web server, you could visit the file there, and the location
would be a web address that starts with <code>http://</code> or
<code>https:</code></aside>


<h2 class="step">Create a film roll of your photos</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see that CSS can be used to position content.</p>

<p>Sub steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2-put-images-in-frame</li>
  <li>3-force-frame-to-show-one</li>
  <li>4-put-images-in-a-row</li>
  <li>5-scrolling-the-film</li>
</ul>

<p>GOAL, INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>


<h2 class="step">Create a reference to the film role</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see that you can create a reference an HTML element, and explore
the element's properties in the console.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>


<h2 class="step">Create a scroll function</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To introduce setInterval, and how it can be used to create a simple
animations.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>


<h2 class="step">Extend the scroll function</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>(Maybe this is all part of the previous step)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>


<h2 class="step">Add a keydown event listener</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see that we can give control of the slide show to the user.</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>


<h2 class="step">Add a keydown event listener</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see that we can give control of the slide show to the user.</p>

<p>(this is steps 11, 12 and 13 combined)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>


<h2 class="step">Correct buggy behaviour</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>To see how to prevent events from having an effect when it's not
desireable.</p>

<p>(First step will be to notice the bug and think of what's
causing it)</p>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION for each</p>



<h2>Next!</h2>

<p>Now that we've changed CSS, let's change the HTML too!</p>
