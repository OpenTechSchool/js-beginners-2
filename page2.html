<h1>Curriculum: page 2, picture slide show</h1>

<p>We'll learn how JavaScript can make content dynamic and
interactive.</p>

<p>For this project, we will create a photo slide show. You'll have
more fun if your slide show is made from your own photos, or at least
photos you like. So step one is:</p>

<h2 class="step">Download images from Flickr</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Get some nice photos to use in your slide show.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Create a directory for your entire project and call it
“slideshow”</p>

<p>Within your new <code>slideshow</code> directory, create a
directory called “images”</p>

<p>Download three photos and save them in your
<code>slideshow/images</code> directory.
<br>The photos must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a width of around 500 pixels.</li>
  <li>All have the same dimensions in pixels.</li>
  <li>All have the same orientation (all landscape, portrait, or
    square)</li>
  <li>Be photos you like. You will look at them all day!</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: you can download any three photos, and edit them to be all
the same size and shape. If you need help finding photos or editing
them, ask a coach for help.</p>
