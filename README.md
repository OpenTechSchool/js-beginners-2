# Curriculum â€” JavaScript for web pages

**Please note: The curriculum is a bit outdated as it contains animations implemented with JavaScript that would rather be implemented with CSS today. It used to be part 2 (day 2) of the [JavaScript for absolute beginners workshop](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/js-beginners-1) but is not actively being used any more.**

This curriculum introduces enhancing web pages with JavaScript. You should have some very basic knowledge of programming with JavaScript like variables, loops, and functions.

The purpose of the example slideshow is to introduce the following concepts:

* HTML as a representation of content
* CSS as a means of defining appearance of the content
* using the web inspector to alter CSS
* using JS to change the style of HTML elements
* adding event listeners to the document
* using JS to edit HTML of elements in the document

This example could be extended to illustrate:

* adding event listeners to elements (clicking on navigation, rather than using arrow keys)
* how to make the scrolling loop back to the start
* the power of CSS to alter appearance
* how a library such as jQuery could be used
* how a library or plug-in to one could replace this code
