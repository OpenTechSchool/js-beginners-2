The purpose of the example slideshow is to introduce the following concepts:

* HTML as a representation of content
* CSS as a means of defining appearance of the content
* using the web inspector to alter CSS
* using JS to change the style of HTML elements
* adding event listeners to the document

This example could be extended to illustrate:

* using JS to create HTML elements within the document (building the slideshow from an array of src paths)
* adding event listeners to elements (clicking on navigation, rather than using arrow keys)
* how to make the scrolling loop back to the start
* the power of CSS to alter appearance
* how a library such as jQuery could be used
* how a library or plug-in to one could replace this code
