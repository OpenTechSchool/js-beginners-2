<h1>Curriculum: page 1, HTML &amp; CSS</h1>

<p>We'll learn how web pages are structured, and how to change the
appearance of the content.</p>


<h2 class="step">View the source</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Understand how content for the web looks as raw HTML.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>View the source of this page. One way to do that is to right click
anywhere within the browser display window, and choose
'View Page Source'.</p>

<p>You will see the source HTML for this page. Read it.</p>

<!-- This is a comment. It is not displayed. -->

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Web pages are written in plain text with no styling. So, no bold or
italics, colors, fonts or layout.</p>

<p>The text in angle brackets (<em>tags</em>) provides meta
information about the content structure. P stands for paragraph, for
example. We put our content between pairs of tags to define what the
content is, and to determines how the text will appear.</p>

<p>There are start tags such as <code>&lt;p></code> and ends tags like
<code>&lt;/p></code>. Some tags that don't wrap around anything else
and are called <em>empty elements</em>. For example, to include an
image we use the <code>&lt;img></code> tag plus a <code>src</code>
attribute to indicate the address of the image file.</p>

<img src=http://amish-geeks.de/Khark/lolcat.jpg>

<p>This page also has a <code>&lt;head></code> section where meta data
about the entire page is defined. You'll see that's how the browser
knows what the title of the page is, but you'll also see this
line:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel=stylesheet href=style.css></pre>

<p>This line says that an external 'style sheet' should be applied. A
style sheet is the place we can define the appearance of our HTML.
Let's pretend we didn't see that for a moment.</p>


<h2 class="step">View HTML that has no style sheet.</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Understand that HTML has meaning even before we define the
appearance.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open the <a href="nocss.html" target="_blank">example page</a>
that has no style sheet.</p>

<p>View the source of the example page. Read it.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>No where in this HTML page have we said how big to make the
heading, that text in <code>&lt;strong></code> tags should be bold,
that <code>&lt;em></code> should be italic, that there should be space
above and below <code>&lt;p></code> tags.</p>

<p>These tags have <em>meaning</em> and so the browser displays the
content in a style that makes sense to most humans that read it.
That's kind, but wouldn't it be great to to be able to choose what
font, what color, what position, and well, LOTS of things about the
appearance? We can do that! We can do that in a style sheet.</p>


<h2 class="step">View HTML that has style sheets</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Understand how to set the appearance of content on web pages.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>Open the <a href="hascss.html" target="_blank">example page</a>
that has style sheets.</p>

<p>View the source of the example page. Read it.</p>

<p>Open the <a href="style.css">external style sheet</a> of the
example page. Read it.</p>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>Style sheets are a collection of 'rules'. Each rule says which
content the rule applies to and how that content ought to look. The
language we write these rules in is 'CSS'. CSS is how to make our
HTML content look the way <em>we</em> want.</p>

<p>Here is one of the rules in CSS:</p>

<pre>
p {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: lightgrey;
  line-height: 1.3em;
}
</pre>

<p>This rule says "paragraphs have no space around them, space inside
of 10 pixels on all sides, with a light grey background, and the lines
should have a height of 1.3 times the height of the font."</p>

<p>When two different rules refere to the same content, both rules are
applied, but the one that comes second wins any arguments.</p>

<pre>
em {
  font-style: normal;
  background-color: orange;
}
em {
  background-color: pink;
}
</pre>

<p>The first rule says that everything in an <code>&lt;em></code> tags
should be normal (instead of italic, which is usual), and have an
orange background, like <em style="font-style: normal;
background-color: orange;">this</em>. But the second rule says nothing
about font style, thought says the background should be pink. That
looks like <em style="background-color: pink;">this</em>.</p>

<p>When both rules are written in this order, the first one adds style
but the second one wins for color, and the result looks like <em
style="font-style: normal; background-color: pink;">this</em>.

<h2>More JavaScript please!</h2>

<p>There is a lot to learn about both HTML and CSS, but hopefully
that's enough of an introduction will help us so we add our magic
power: JavaScript!</p>
